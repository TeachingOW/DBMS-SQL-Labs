# Lab 2.1


Getting Started:
### Step 1: Create the database
```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS lab2;
CREATE DATABASE lab2;
USE lab2;
```
### Step 2: Add Tables
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Enrolled;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Student;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Course;

CREATE TABLE  Student (
    		sid int,
		    fname char(20),
		    lname char(20),
		    gpa float,
		    PRIMARY KEY (sid)
);
CREATE TABLE  Course (
	 	cid int Primary key,
  		code char(10),
  		name char(40),
  		credithours smallint
);  
CREATE TABLE  Enrolled (
    sid int,
    cid int,
    grade char(2),
    PRIMARY KEY (sid,cid)
);

ALTER TABLE Enrolled ADD FOREIGN KEY (sid) references Student(sid);
ALTER TABLE Enrolled ADD FOREIGN KEY (cid) references Course(cid);
```
### Step 3: Add data
```sql
INSERT INTO Student VALUES(1,'Amie','Massey',3);
INSERT INTO Student VALUES(2,'Abigail','Larsen',NULL);

### Query I
Find all name of students that have got A or A+ in Database Course, ordered by their name.
We need all the three tables: Student for his(her) name, Enrolled for the grade and Course for database course name.
As we have three tables, we need two join conditions

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  
  ```sql
  SELECT concat(fname,' ',lname) name 
FROM Student s, Course C, Enrolled E
WHERE C.cid=E.cid 
  AND s.sid=E.sid
  AND (E.grade='A+' OR E.grade='A')
  AND C.name like '%DATABASE' 
  ORDER BY name
```
  NOTE:
Make sure to understand all parts of the solution up there.
</details>


### Query 2
Find all countries that manufacture some product in the ‘Gadgets’ category.
Assume you have the following data:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Company;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Product;

CREATE TABLE Product(
	PName char(20) Primary key,
  	Price double,
  	category char(20),
  	Manufacturer char(20)
);

CREATE TABLE Company(
	CName char(20) Primary key,
  	StockPrice double,
  	Country char(20)
);

ALTER TABLE Product ADD FOREIGN KEY (Manufacturer) references Company(CName);

INSERT INTO Company VALUES('GizmoWorks',25,'USA');
INSERT INTO Company VALUES('Canon',65,'Japan');
INSERT INTO Company VALUES('Hitachi',15, 'Japan');

INSERT INTO Product VALUES('Gizmo',19.99,'Gadgets','GizmoWorks');
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('Powergizmo',29.99,'Gadgets','GizmoWorks');
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('SingleTouch',149.99,'Photography','Canon');
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('MultiTouch',203.99,'Household','Hitachi');
SELECT Country FROM Product, Company
WHERE Manufacturer=CName AND Category='Gadgets'
```

This would return:
Country
USA
USA
How to get USA only once.


### Query 3: An Unintuitive Query
Prepare the database as follows:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS R;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS T;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS S;

CREATE TABLE R(A int);
CREATE TABLE S(A int);
CREATE TABLE T(A int);

INSERT INTO R VALUES (1);
INSERT INTO R VALUES (1);
INSERT INTO R VALUES (2);
INSERT INTO R VALUES (3);
INSERT INTO R VALUES (5);
INSERT INTO R VALUES (7);
INSERT INTO R VALUES (7);
INSERT INTO R VALUES (8);

INSERT INTO S VALUES (1);
INSERT INTO S VALUES (1);
INSERT INTO S VALUES (2);
INSERT INTO S VALUES (3);

INSERT INTO T VALUES (1);
INSERT INTO T VALUES (2);
INSERT INTO T VALUES (3);
INSERT INTO T VALUES (7);
```
Run this query
```sql
SELECT  DISTINCT R.A
FROM R, S, T
WHERE R.A=S.A OR R.A=T.A
```
This would return the following
| A |
|---|
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |
| 7 |

Remove all tuples from S
```sql 
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
DELETE FROM S;
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
```
MySQL has something called safe mode, to disable it. We run SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0; and to enable it again SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
Rerun the query
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT R.A
FROM   R, S, T
WHERE  R.A=S.A OR R.A=T.A
```

### Multiset Operations
MySQL does not have INTERSECT or EXCEPT keyword. In the next lecture, we will explain an alternative.
*Compare these two queries *
```sql
SELECT  R.A 
FROM   R, S 
WHERE  R.A=S.A
UNION  
SELECT R.A 
FROM   R, T  
WHERE  R.A=T.A 
```
```sql
SELECT  R.A
FROM   R, S
WHERE  R.A=S.A
UNION ALL
SELECT R.A
FROM   R, T
WHERE  R.A=T.A
```


#### Try the following SQL code
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Product;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Company;

CREATE TABLE Product(
  PName char(20) Primary key,
    maker char(20),
    factory_loc char(20)
);
CREATE TABLE Company(
  CName char(20) Primary key,
    hq_city char(20)
);

ALTER TABLE Product ADD FOREIGN KEY (maker) references Company(CName);

INSERT INTO Company VALUES('X co.','Seattle');
INSERT INTO Company VALUES('Y inc.','Seattle');
INSERT INTO Company VALUES('A co.', 'Tokyo');

INSERT INTO Product VALUES('X','X co.','US');
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('A','A co.','China');
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('A+','A co.','US');
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('Y','Y inc.','China');
```
Compare the three queries below:
```sql
SELECT hq_city
FROM   Company, Product
WHERE  maker = cname 
  AND factory_loc='US'
AND hq_city in (
SELECT hq_city
FROM   Company, Product
WHERE  maker = cname
AND factory_loc='China'
);
```
```sql
SELECT maker, hq_city
FROM   Company, Product
WHERE  maker = cname 
  AND factory_loc='US'
AND (maker,hq_city) in (
SELECT maker, hq_city
FROM   Company, Product
WHERE  maker = cname
AND factory_loc='China'
);
```
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT hq_city
FROM   Company, Product
WHERE  maker = cname 
       AND cname IN (
		SELECT maker
	  	FROM   Product
	  	WHERE  factory_loc = 'US')
	 AND cname IN (
		SELECT maker
	  	FROM   Product
	  	WHERE  factory_loc = 'China');
```

### To Delete or update multiple rows
To disable safe updates or delete
```sql
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;
```

To enable them back

```sql
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;
```




# Lab2.2

Run the following query
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT hq_city
FROM   Company, Product
WHERE  maker = cname 
       AND cname IN (
    SELECT maker
      FROM   Product
      WHERE  factory_loc = 'US')
   AND cname IN (
    SELECT maker
      FROM   Product
      WHERE  factory_loc = 'China')
```
To understand the previous query, you may break it into three parts.

Q1:
```sql
    SELECT maker
    FROM   Product
      WHERE  factory_loc = 'US'
     ``` 
Q2:
```sql
SELECT maker
      FROM   Product
      WHERE  factory_loc = 'China'
```
Q3:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM   Company, Product
WHERE  maker = cname 
```

Another way:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT hq_city
FROM   Company, (SELECT maker
      FROM   Product
      WHERE  factory_loc = 'US') US, 
      (SELECT maker
      FROM   Product
      WHERE  factory_loc = 'China') Ch
WHERE  us.maker = cname 
AND    ch.maker= cname 
```
Another one:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT hq_city
FROM   Company, Product p1,   Product p2
WHERE  p1.maker = cname 
AND    p2.maker= cname 
AND  p1.factory_loc = 'US'
AND  p2.factory_loc = 'China';
```
### Example 

```sql
DROP table if exists company;
DROP table if exists Product;
DROP table if exists Purchase;

CREATE TABLE Company (
cname char(20) Primary key,
city char(20)
);

CREATE TABLE Product (
  pname char(20) ,
  maker char(20),
  price double,
  Foreign key (maker) REFERENCES company(cname),
  primary key (pname, maker)
);

CREATE TABLE Purchase 
(id int primary key,
 product char(20),
 buyer varchar(30),
Foreign key (product) REFERENCES Product(pname)
 );

INSERT INTO Company VALUES('X co','Seattle');
INSERT INTO Company VALUES('Y co','Jeffersonville');
INSERT INTO Company VALUES('A co','Seattle');
INSERT INTO Company VALUES('A inc','LA');
INSERT INTO Company VALUES('B co','NYC');
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('X','X co',20);
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('X+','X co',10);
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('Y','Y co',5);
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('A','A co',8);
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('T','A co',18);
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('A','A inc',5);
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('AA','A co',30);
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('AAA','A co',20);
INSERT INTO Product VALUES('B','B co',8);
INSERT INTO Purchase VALUES(1,'A','Joe Blow');
INSERT INTO Purchase VALUES(2,'A','Joe Smith');
INSERT INTO Purchase VALUES(3,'A','John Oliver');
INSERT INTO Purchase VALUES(4,'A','John Oliver');
INSERT INTO Purchase VALUES(5,'Y','Joe Blow');
INSERT INTO Purchase VALUES(6,'X','Joe Blow');
INSERT INTO Purchase VALUES(7,'A','Joe Blow');
INSERT INTO Purchase VALUES(8,'A','Joe Blow');
INSERT INTO Purchase VALUES(9,'A','Joe Blow');
```

### Query Q1
Cities where one can find companies that manufacture products bought
by "Joe Blow”.
```sql
SELECT  c.city
FROM   Company c
WHERE  c.cname  IN (
  SELECT pr.maker
      FROM   Purchase p, Product pr
      WHERE  p.product = pr.pname 
     AND p.buyer = 'Joe Blow')
```    
Note that we got Seattle twice for X co and A co

### Query Q2
```sql
SELECT c.city
 FROM   Company c, 
        Product p, 
        Purchase pu
 WHERE  c.cname = p.maker
   AND  p.pname = pu.product
   AND  pu.buyer = 'Joe Blow'
```
Compare the  previous two queries.

### Question 1
Find products that are more expensive than all those produced by “X co”
<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>


```sql
SELECT pname
FROM   Product
WHERE  price > ALL(
  SELECT price
     FROM   Product
     WHERE  maker = 'X co')
```
  </details>
  
 ### Question 2 
Find ‘copycat’ products, i.e. products made by competitors with the same names as products made by ‘A co’

 <details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  
```sql
 SELECT p1.pname
FROM   Product p1
WHERE  p1.maker = 'A co'
   AND EXISTS(
  SELECT p2.pname
      FROM   Product p2
      WHERE  p2.maker <> 'A co'
     AND p1.pname = p2.pname)
```
</details>
  
```sql
DROP TABLE Purchase;
CREATE TABLE Purchase (
product char(20), 
pdate date, 
price double,
 quantity int
);
INSERT INTO Purchase VALUES('bagel','2021-10-21',1,20);
INSERT INTO Purchase VALUES('banana','2021-10-3',0.5,10);
INSERT INTO Purchase VALUES('banana','2021-10-10',1,10);
INSERT INTO Purchase VALUES('bagel','2021-10-25',1.5,20);
```

  Note that we do not have a primary key.

Get the number of purchases.

  ```sql
  select count(*) from purchase
  ```
  
Find the sales after ‘10/10/2021’
```sql
  SELECT product,
SUM(price * quantity) AS TotalSales
FROM Purchase
WHERE pdate > '2021-10-10'
GROUP BY product
  ```
Another way for the same query:
  ```sql
SELECT DISTINCT  x.product,
(SELECT Sum(y.price*y.quantity)  
FROM Purchase y WHERE  x.product = y.product AND y.pdate > '2021-10-10')   TotalSales FROM Purchase x WHERE  x.pdate > '2021-10-10'
```
  ### HAVING Clause 
Same query as before, except that we consider only products that have more than 100 buyers
  ```sql
SELECT   product, SUM(price*quantity)
FROM     Purchase
WHERE    pdate > '2021-10-1'
GROUP BY product
HAVING   SUM(quantity) > 100
  ```


Purchase

| Id | Product | Price | Quantity |
|----|---------|-------|----------|
| 1  | bagel   | 1.0   | 5        |
| 2  | banana  | 0.5   | 6        |
| 3  | Juice   | 1.0   | 4        |
| 4  | donuts  | 1.5   | 8        |
| 5  | bagel   | 1.5   | 7        |
| 6  | banana  | 1.0   | 4        |
| 7  | banana  | 1.0   | 3        |
| 8  | juice   | 3.0   | 5        |

```sql

DROP TABLE IF Exists Purchase;
CREATE TABLE Purchase (
  ID int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  Product char(20),
  Price Decimal(10,2),
  Quantity int
  );

INSERT INTO Purchase(Product, Price, Quantity) values('bagel',1.0,5),
('banana',.5,6), ('juice',1.0,4),
('donuts', 1.5,8), ('bagel', 1.5,7),
('banana',1.0,4),('banana',1,3), ('juice',3.0,5)
;
```
*NOTE:*
AUTO_INCREMENT, and how we insert into the table.
```sql
SELECT SUM(Price*Quantity) as Total_sales
FROM Purchase
WHERE product='bagel'
```
1. Executing from & WHERE

| Id | Product | Price | Quantity |
|----|---------|-------|----------|
| 1  | bagel   | 1.0   | 5        |
| 5  | bagel   | 1.5   | 7        |

2. Computing the aggregate.

| Price| X | Quantity|    
|------|---|---------|
| 1.0  | x | 5 |
| 1.5  | x | 7 |
| 15.5 |   |   |

### COUNT() vs COUNT(DISTINCT)
Run the following two queries:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Purchase;
```
```sql 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product)
FROM Purchase;
```

First query returns 8 while the second returns 4.

### Group By clause
The following query would find the total number of the units sold from all products.
```sql
SELECT SUM(Quantity) 
FROM Purchase
```
The query returns 36.
To find the number of units sold for each product.
```sql
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) 
FROM Purchase
GROUP BY Product
```



Find products and the sales that has sold more than 10 units.
<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```sql
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity*Price)
FROM Purchase
GROUP BY Product
HAVING SUM(Quantity)> 10
  

```

|Product | SUM(Quantity*Price)|
|--------|-------|
| bagel  | 15.50 |
| banana | 10.00 |
  
</details>
    
Find the product with the most units sold.
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
  

```sql

  SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity*Price)
FROM Purchase
GROUP BY Product
HAVING SUM(Quantity)= (
  SELECT MAX(t.units) 
  FROM  
  (SELECT SUM(Quantity) as units 
   FROM Purchase
   GROUP BY Product) t
);
```
 
</details>
  
To understand the query, let us start with:
```sql
SELECT SUM(Quantity) 
FROM Purchase
GROUP BY Product
```
```sql
SELECT MAX(t.units) 
FROM  (SELECT SUM(Quantity) as units 
     FROM Purchase
     GROUP BY Product) t
```
The query above finds the maximum of the total unit sold.



Run the following queries, to create the schema:
```sql
drop table if exists product;
drop table if exists supplier;

create table supplier(
id int,
sname varchar(30) not null,
primary key (id),
unique(sname)
);

create table product(
id int primary key, 
pname varchar(30) not null,
price float,
supplierid int,
foreign key (supplierid) references supplier(id)
);
```
Insert Data
```sql
insert into supplier(id, sname) values (1, 'bike Ltd');
insert into supplier(id, sname) values (2, 'bike USA');
insert into supplier(id, sname) values (3, 'bikes4all');

insert into product values (1,'girl bike', 110, 1);
insert into product values (2,'boy bike', 110, 2);
insert into product values (3,'mountain bike', 510, 2);
insert into product values (4,'bike', 180, NULL );
insert into product values (5,'ebike', 280, NULL );
```
Try to insert the following
```
insert into supplier(id, sname) values (4, 'bike Ltd');
```
The previous SQL insert should not work, as we have specified that  the supplier name to be unique.


Q1:

Find all products with unknown supplier.

A supplier of a product is recorded in product table
to find out products with unknown supplier, we need to find those that are NULL.
<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```sql
  SELECT * from product where supplierid IS NULL
```  
</details>
  
Q2:
Find all suppliers with no product listed.
<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

  ```sql
SELECT * from Supplier s
WHERE NOT exists (select * from product p
  where p.supplierid=s.id)
``` 

</details> 

Q3:
For each product list the supplier information.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   supplier s, Product p
WHERE  s.id = p.supplierid
 ```
Another way to write the above query
is by using join clause, as follow:
  
```sql
select * from product p 
join supplier s 
on p.supplierid=s.id;
```
 However, running the above query, you are not returning
information about Products with no supplier information (e.g., products with id 4 and 5).
```sql
  select * from product p 
left outer join supplier s 
on p.supplierid=s.id;
```
  
 </details> 
 
 Q4:
Find supplier (along with the supplied products)

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```sql
select * from product p
right outer join supplier s 
on p.supplierid=s.id;
```
</details>
  Q5
Find supplier and products including not matched
<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```sql
select * from product p 
full outer join supplier s 
on p.supplierid=s.id;
```
Mysql does not support full outer join. It is can executed as follow:
```sql
select * from product p 
left outer join supplier s 
on p.supplierid=s.id
union
select * from product p 
right outer join supplier s 
on p.supplierid=s.id;
```
  </details>
  
 ```sql
 create table student (SID int primary key,Name varchar(10),Major

 CREATE TABLE enrolled (SID int,cid varchar(5),primary key
 (sid,cid)); 
 insert into student values (40,'alex','cs'), (41, 'john','cs'), (42, 'mat', 'cs'), (43, 'zack', 'math');
 insert into Enrolled values (40,'cs101'),(40,  'cs102'),(41, 'cs101'),(41,  'cs404'),(41,'cs405'), (42,'cs101'),(42,'cs102'),(42,'cs203'),(43,'cs101'),(43,'cs102');

```
  
```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT NAME FROM STUDENT S WHERE major=‘cs’ AND  NOT EXISTS
     (SELECT * FROM ENROLLED E2  WHERE SID=40 AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT *
     FROM ENROLLED E WHERE E.SID=S.SID AND E2.CID=E.CID) )
