## In-Class Exercise (from UMM)

Feel Free to search for the exact command format.

In particular you are going to need to figure out how the `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements work.  You will also need to figure out a little bit about SQL data-types.  If you have any questions feel free to ask. With that in mind, here's what I
want you to do (or have already done):

1. Create your database.  You will use this database for all your work.

2. Create a table called `workers` with the following fields (all capital):

Column Name | Description
------------|--------------
EMPLOYEE    | The person's name
MANAGER     | The manager's name
JOB         | A job title
SALARY      | a yearly salary
YEARS_WORKED| The number of years worked

You get to pick the data-types for the fields

1. Enter data that satisfies ALL of the following restrictions into your table:
  *  Roberts, Ruskin, and Raphael are all ticket agents.
  *  Rayburn is a baggage handler.
  *  Rice is a flight mechanic.
  *  Price manages all ticket agents.
  *  Powell manages Rayburn.
  *  Porter manages Rice, Price, Powell and himself.
  *  Powell is head of ground crews and Porter is chief of operations.
  *  Every employee receives a 10% raise for each complete year worked.
  *  Roberts, Ruskin, Raphael, and Rayburn all started at $12,000. Roberts just started work, Ruskin
and Raphael have worked for a year and a half, and Rayburn has worked for 2 years.
  *  Rice started at $18,000 and now makes $21,780.
  *  Price and Powell started at $16,000 and have both been working for three years.
  *  Porter started at $20,000 and has been around two years longer than anyone else.
